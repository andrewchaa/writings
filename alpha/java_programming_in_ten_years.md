programming in java in 10 years
=====================

I learned java at Uni. and worked really hard. Yet, I didn't have chance to use it when I becaue a full time programmer.
I was a Delphi and VB guy and then C# man. I didn't plan it, but it turned out that my career was more oriented toward Microsoft Stack.

And, now I'm reading [TDD By Example](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Driven-Development-Addison-Wesley-Signature-Series/dp/0321146530/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1344332680&sr=8-1). 
This is my third read, and I thought it might be fun to try the examples in java. Previously, I converted those examples to C# code. 
So, this is my experience with java.

Java IDE
--------------------

You need an ide to code. as I am a loyal ReSharper user, my first choic was IntelliJ. It was funny, that most of things I loved about ReSharper, actually came from IntelliJ.
[Community Edition](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) is free. 


Hello World
--------------------

Writing "Hello, World!" is a challenge, if you do not know the eco-system of the language. Java syntax is very similar to C#, yet I didn't know how to write a simple console application. jetbrains' wiki had a nice tutorial about [how to create the first java application](http://wiki.jetbrains.net/intellij/Creating_and_running_your_first_Java_application).

This is my code, nothing clever or unusual.

'''java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
'''
